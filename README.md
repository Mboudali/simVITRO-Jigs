# simVITRO-Jigs
CAD files describing testing jigs and clamps compatible with simVITRO biomechanical platform.


PTFJ testing jig: 
CAD files of the testing jig used in the study of the patellofemoral joint. 
Femoral clamp:
- Base: Interface between the ATI loadcell and the femoral ring clamps. Comes in two version: a flat version and an oblique for added flexibility to perform deep knee bend. 
- Rings: Rods will need to go through the rings and the femur for added stability. A minimum of four are required to secure the femur. Two M8 bolts are required to fix the two section of a ring toguether and one is used to secure half a ring to the base. 

Tibial clamp:
- Base: Interface between the memory clamp of the simVITRO platform and the tibial clamp.
- Half cyclinder clamp: Two halves are required to clamp the tibia. M4 bolts are inserted in the threaded holes untill making secure contact with the tibia bone. Aminimum of four M3 bolts are required to fix the two section toguether. Two M8 bolts are used to secure the formed cylinder and the base.

Patella tracker:
- Plate: Fixed to the patellar bone using two self taping small screws. Hosts two 5x1mm magnets.
- Tracker holder: hold a marker set using one M4 screw. Hosts two 5x1mm magnets (Warming!!! Poles of holder magnets need to match those of the plate)
- Marker set: 6 unique marker set clusters receiving four reflective markers. Can be replaced by QR code trackers.
